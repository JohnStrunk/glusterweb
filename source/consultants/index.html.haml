      %p BioDec helps in designing, building, and mantaining IT infrastructures to support complex systems and organizations. We design and build them with free software and open standards: GNU/Linux(we use Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS) as the operating system, many different software for the server virtualization (Ganeti, KVM, OpenNebula), specialized tools to manage large data (GlusterFS, Riak), and Python. We maintain them using automation (SaltStack, Cfengine3, Puppet), pervasive monitoring (Nagios, Graphite, Collectd, Statsd, Logstash), and Agile IT (a.k.a.devops) approaches.
