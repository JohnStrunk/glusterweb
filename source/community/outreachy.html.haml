%h2 Introducing instrumentation tooling into Gluster
%p.lead
  The suite of tools available to undertake performance related instrumentation
  on Linux has improved over the period of years. As various layered products -
  clustered applications; distributed storage and such were adopted and
  deployed at large scale, administrators have constantly voiced a need to
  improve upon the methods, tools and data processing capabilities of the
  tools.
%p.lead
  Gluster is a software defined distributed storage system which would readily
  benefit of a structured approach to instrumentation. There already exist
  known methods to trace specific issues on the Gluster stack. These include
  and are not limited to SystemTap, PCP, and read-write performance tools like
  iozone and such.
%p.lead
  The scope of the project is to (a) identify a first pass set of
  instrumentation framework to be adopted and made available to the community
  as a recommended approach (b) design, develop, deploy and evangelize a set of
  working examples of instrumentation hooks which provide adequate spectrum of
  information (c) document the usage of the framework in a variety of
  deployment environments viz. bare-metal, hyperconverged and public cloud
  deployments
%p.lead
  Initial Contribution: We intend this exercise to help applicants familiarize
  themselves with Gluster and also run some performance tests against a Gluster
  setup. In addition to this, an understanding of how the applicant perceives
  instrumentation and analysis of the results from such an exercise. Part or
  most of the instrumentation developed as a part of this project would land in
  the
  %a{ :href =>  'https://github.com/gluster/gbench' }
    Gluster bench project.
  As an initial contribution an applicant could attempt the following:
%li.lead
  Run the basic bench test provided in
  %a{ :href => 'https://github.com/gluster/gbench/tree/master/bench-tests/bt-0000-0001' }
    the repo
  against a Gluster cluster.
%li.lead Provide the resulting results
%li.lead
  Additionally provide one or more system resource usage gathered during the
  run, with optional analysis of the same
%p.lead
  When you're finished with this, please add your contribution to the
  %a{ :href => 'mailto:gluster-devel@gluster.org' }
    gluster-devel@gluster.org
  mailing list for review.

  Operator focused documentation for Gluster
%p.lead
  Documentation is always hard in large open source projects!  There are issues
  with stale documentation; correctness of the content; focus and approach and
  even whether it enables a reasonably proficient administrator to get up to
  speed.
%p.lead
  The scope of this project to create a first version of the documentation and
  content which can be consumed by operators intending to bootstrap Gluster
  with technologies like Kubernetes and OpenShift. Within the scope is the
  testing and documentation of the sequence of steps; creating a playbook can
  be easily extended and refreshed; adding any demo videos and such which are
  supplementary companions to the documentation. The target audience for this
  set of content is someone planning to use Gluster as a persistent store for
  applications which are managed via Kubernetes etc
%p.lead
  At the end of the project the candidate will have acquired a sufficient depth
  and understanding of Gluster in a micro-services environment; creating
  scripts to build and tear-down small set-ups; interview operators and
  developers to enhance documentation.

  for our overall project. Please choose something in our documentation that
  you'd like to make a meaningful improvement to, and submit a pull request. As
  you do so, please tag github user
