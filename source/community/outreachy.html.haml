%h1 Introducing instrumentation tooling into Gluster
%p.lead
  The suite of tools available to undertake performance related
  instrumentation on Linux has improved over the period of years. As
  various layered products - clustered applications; distributed storage
  and such were adopted and deployed at large scale, administrators
  have constantly voiced a need to improve upon the methods, tools and
  data processing capabilities of the tools.
%p.lead
  Gluster is a software defined distributed storage system which would
  readinly benefit of a structured approach to instrumentation. There
  already exist known methods to trace specific issues on the Gluster
  stack. These include and are not limited to SystemTap, PCP, and
  read-write performance tools like iozone and such.
%p.lead
  The scope of the project is to (a) identify a first pass set of
  instrumentation framework to be adopted and made available to the
  community as a recommended approach (b) design, develop, deploy and
  evangelize a set of working examples of instrumentation hooks which
  provide adequate spectrum of information (c) document the usage of the
  framework in a variety of deployment enviroments viz. bare-metal,
  hyperconverged and public cloud deployments


%h1
  Operator focused documentation for Gluster
%p.lead
  Documentation is always hard in large open source projects!
  There are issues with stale documentation; correctness of
  the content; focus and approach and even whether it enables a
  reasonably proficient administrator to get up to speed.
%p.lead
  The scope of this project to create a first version of the
  documentation and content which can be consumed by operators intending
  to bootstrap Gluster with technologies like Kubernetes and
  OpenShift. Within the scope is the testing and documentation of the
  sequence of steps; creating a playbook can be easily extended and
  refreshed; adding any demo videos and such which are supplementary
  companions to the documentation. The target audience for this set of
  content is someone planning to use Gluster as a persistent store for
  applications which are managed via Kubernetes etc
%p.lead
  At the end of the project the candidate will have acquired a
  sufficient depth and understanding of Gluster in a micro-services
  environment; creating scripts to build and tear-down small set-ups;
  interview operators and developers to enhance documentation.
