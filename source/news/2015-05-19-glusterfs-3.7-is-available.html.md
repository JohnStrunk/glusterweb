### We are happy to announce that Gluster 3.7.0 is now generally available. 

Version 3.7.0 contains several new features and it is one of our more feature  packed releases in recent times. The [release notes contain a  description of new functionality added to 3.7.0](https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs/blob/release-3.7/doc/release-notes/3.7.0.md). In addition, 3.7.0 also contains several bug fixes and minor improvements.  It is highly recommended to test 3.7.0 thoroughly for your use cases  before deploying in production.

Gluster 3.7.0 [can be downloaded from our download server as usual](http://download.gluster.org/pub/gluster/glusterfs/3.7/3.7.0/). If you wish to upgrade from an earlier version, [please see the upgrading instructions](http://gluster.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Upgrade-Guide/Upgrade%20to%203.7/). Packages for various distributions will be available  shortly at the download site.

Testing feedback and patches for issues observed in 3.7.0 are very  welcome. If you would like to propose bug fix candidates or minor  features for inclusion in 3.7.1, [please add them to the tracker](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/showdependencytree.cgi?maxdepth=1&id=glusterfs-3.7.1&hide_resolved=1).  We intend to do fairly regular releases for stabilizing 3.7.x based on  your feedback.

Niels [has explained some of the new features in a blog post](http://blog.nixpanic.net/2015/05/glusterfs-370-has-been-released.html), you might find that an interesting read as well.

Thanks to everybody who has contributed in diverse ways to Gluster 3.7.0!
