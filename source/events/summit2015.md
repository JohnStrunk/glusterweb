### The ants are marching!

On May 12th and 13th, the Gluster contributor community is coming together
to discuss the state of Gluster and the plans for the future in sunny
Barcelona, Spain.

This event, sponsored by [DataLab](http://www.datalab.es), 
[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com), 
[Institut Municipal d'Inform√†tica](http://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/), and 
[Red Hat](http://www.redhat.com), is filled with two days worth of topics centered around how Gluster 
can grow as a community and as a technology platform. 

It is being held at the 
[H10 Marina Hotel](https://www.h10hotels.com/en/barcelona-hotels/h10-marina-barcelona/). 
The event itself is invitation only, but if you'd like a last minute invite, 
please email the Summit coordinator (Tom Callaway <tcallawa@redhat.com>).
